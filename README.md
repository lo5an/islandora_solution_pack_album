# Audio Album Solution Pack

## Introduction

The Audio Album Solution Pack is a sample solution pack that closely mirrors the Compound Object solution pack, but with the more focused theme of pairing Audio Solution Pack objects with a parent 'Album' object. To that end, it contains simplifications that make it easier to demonstrate the hooks necessary to modify object relational RELS-EXT, as well as demonstrations of other hooks.
